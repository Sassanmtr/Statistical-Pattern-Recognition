# Statistical Pattern Recognition
 Codes for the Assignments of Statistical Pattern Recognition Course, offered by Prof. Thomas Brox at Freiburg University in Summer semester of 2021.
 
 Note that the original assignments (which are not updated) demand the MATLAB code, however in this semester, we did the same tasks, but in Python.
